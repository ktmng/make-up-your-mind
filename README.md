# Make-Up Your Mind üß†
An application for make-up lovers to search and view a variety of products from different brands in addition to watching videos related to what they searched for. Users can view the products along with their preset corresponding descriptions, prices, and links to purchase them. Users may also choose to view the videos either in the window or in a new tab by clicking the respective links. 

## Motivation
I watch a lot of beauty channels on Youtube and enjoy virtual window shopping for make-up. I simply wanted to put the two together. ‚úåÔ∏è
